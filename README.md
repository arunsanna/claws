## Command Line AWS (CLAWS) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wbailey/claws.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/wbailey/claws) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/wbailey/claws.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wbailey/claws)

This tool provides a simple and powerful way to interact with the hosts in your Amazon Web Services
account via the command line.

It provides a configurable text based interface of the status of your hosts similar to the AWS web
console.  An example of its usage appears below:

It gives you a choice of which host to connect to and invokes the proper ssh command:

### Installation

It is up on rubygems.org so add it to your bundle in the Gemfile

```bash
gem 'claws'
```

or do it the old fashioned way:

```bash
gem install claws
```

After you have the gem installed you will need to _initialize_ it to install a configuation file:

```bash
claws --init
```

Read more about the configuration file in this [wiki post](https://github.com/wbailey/claws/wiki/Configuration-file)

### Usage

Once the initial configuration is completed you can simply run claws from the command line:

```bash
claws
```

The full list of options includes:

```bash
Usage: claws [options]
    -d, --display-only               Display host status only and exit
    -c, --choice N                   Enter the number of the host to automatically connect to
    -i, --init                       Install the default configuration file for the application
    -s, --source S                   define the AWS source - default is ec2
    -v, --version                    Display the version number and exit
```

### To Do

* Add filtering by regular expression for any field

* Integrate with your projects Capistrano definitions so that one can filter by environment and
  roles.

* Add RDS and ELB support
